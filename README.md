# Natural-Langauge-Processing-SEMANTIC-SIMILARITY-
This task is mainly about Semantic Similarities

The first file semantic.py is using a simpler language model('en_core_web_sm') to give similarity scores between
a banana, a cat and a monkey. On the other hand, we used a more complex language model('en_core_web_md') to do the same 
task. Ultimately, I was able to tell the difference between the two models based on their similarity scores routing from the 
same data(banana, cat, monkey).
