Semantic Similarity Analysis
Similarities Between "cat," "monkey," and "banana"
Using en_core_web_md:

Cat and Monkey:

Similarity: High
Reason: Both are animals and share common traits related to living creatures. Their high similarity rating reflects their biological connection.
Cat and Banana:

Similarity: Low
Reason: A banana is a fruit and does not share any common characteristics with a cat. This results in a substantially lower similarity score.
Monkey and Banana:

Similarity: Moderate
Reason: Although a monkey is an animal and a banana is a fruit, monkeys interact with their environment, including fruits. This interaction may lead to 
a somewhat higher similarity score compared to "cat" and "banana."
Example Analysis:

Apple, Wolf, and Dog:
Dog and Wolf: High similarity
Reason: Both are closely related animals (canids), so their similarity rating is expected to be high.
Dog and Apple: Low similarity
Reason: "Dog" (animal) and "apple" (fruit) belong to completely different categories.
Apple and Wolf: Low similarity
Reason: Similar to "dog" and "apple," the similarity score between "apple" and "wolf" should be minimal due to their unrelated categories.
Analysis with en_core_web_sm
Example Analysis:

Monkey and Cat:

Similarity: May show high similarity
Reason: en_core_web_sm may not capture complex relationships as accurately as en_core_web_md, potentially leading to a higher similarity score than is warranted.
Cat and Banana:

Similarity: Likely lower than with en_core_web_md
Reason: en_core_web_sm might assign even lower similarity scores for "cat" and "banana" due to its simpler model.
Monkey and Banana:

Similarity: Similar to en_core_web_md, but with potentially less accurate scores
Reason: en_core_web_sm may provide less nuanced similarity ratings, potentially affecting the accuracy of this comparison.
Model Comparison
en_core_web_sm:

Characteristics: Often assigns higher similarity scores to words with weaker relationships due to its simpler architecture.
Example: "Dog" and "apple" might be rated as having more similarity than is reasonable.
en_core_web_md:

Characteristics: Provides more precise and nuanced similarity ratings using word vectors.
Example: "Dog" and "apple" receive a lower similarity score, reflecting their unrelatedness more accurately.

Summary:
The en_core_web_md model generally captures semantic similarity more accurately due to its use of word vectors, 
which allows it to understand context and subtle relationships between words. In contrast, the en_core_web_sm model, 
being simpler, often provides less accurate similarity scores, especially for less obvious relationships. By comparing 
the results from both models and analyzing specific examples, we can better understand these differences and choose the 
appropriate model for our needs.
